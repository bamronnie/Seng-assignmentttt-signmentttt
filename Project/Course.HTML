    <h1>Course Summary</h1>


    <p id="p1">These are the topic we've learnt during our time at this course:</p>
    
    <h2>Intro to CSS:</h2>

    <p id="p2">We started by identifying what CSS was, its a W3C standard for describing the apperance of HTML elements.
        CSS is like the decoration of your webpage, it beautifies the webpage. 
    </p>
    <p id="p2">After that we look at the syntax of the CSS. Here we found out that a CSS document consists of one or more style rules. And that a rule consists of a <b>selector</b> that identifies the Html element/s that will be affected, then followed by a series of <b>Property-value</b> pairs(each pair is called a declaration).  
    </p>
    <p id="p2">Folowing that was the locations of the CSS code where we learnt that there are three locations: inline, Internal and External.
        <p id="p2" > Inline: Here the CSS is placed within an Html element via the style attribute. </p>
        <p id="p2"> Internal(Embedded): Here the CSS is placed within the <b>style</b> element that is inside the head element of the HTML document  </p>
        <p id="p2"> External: Here the style rules are placed within an eternal text file with the .css extention.</p>
