    <h1>Course Summary</h1>


    <p id="p1">These are the topic we've learnt during our time at this course:</p>
    
    <h2>Intro to CSS:</h2>

    <p id="p2">We started by identifying what CSS was, its a W3C standard for describing the apperance of HTML elements.
        CSS is like the decoration of your webpage, it beautifies the webpage. 
    </p>
    <p id="p2">After that we look at the syntax of the CSS. Here we found out that a CSS document consists of one or more style rules. And that a rule consists of a <b>selector</b> that identifies the Html element/s that will be affected, then followed by a series of <b>Property-value</b> pairs(each pair is called a declaration).  
    </p>
    <p id="p2">Folowing that was the locations of the CSS code where we learnt that there are three locations: inline, Internal and External.
        <ul>
       <li style="color: white;" id="p2"> Inline: Here the CSS is placed within an Html element via the style attribute.  </li> 
       <li style="color: white;" id="p2">  Internal(Embedded): Here the CSS is placed within the <b>style</b> element that is inside the head element of the HTML document   </li>
      <li style="color: white;" id="p2">   External: Here the style rules are placed within an eternal text file with the .css extention. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <h3>Into to Web development:</h3>

    <p id="p3"> In this topic we were introduced to web development and how it works, we looked and the basic terms but we made more emphasis on World Wide Web(WWW).</p>
    <P id="p3">What is the World Wide WEB :</P>
    <P id="p3">World Wide Web (WWW, W3) Is an information space where documments and other web resources are identified by URLs,interlinked by heprtext links, and can be accessed via the internet. It has become Known simply as the Web. </P>
   <p id="p3">Ideas that shaped WWW:</p>
    <ul style="color: white;" id="p3">
    <p id="p3"> The early web community produced some revolutionary ideas that are now spreading far beyond the tech sector:</p>
    <li style="color: white;" id="p3">Decentralisation</li>
    <li style="color: white;" id="p3">Non-discrimination</li>
    <li style="color: white;" id="p3">Bottom-Up design</li>
    <li style="color: white;" id="p3">Universality</li>
</ul>

<h4>How web Works:</h4>
    
    <p id="p4">We disccused internet Protocols in this topic, we didiused that internet Protocols have been implemented in every opertating system, and make fast web development possible.</p>
    <p id="p4">There are <b>MANY</b>application layer protocols. web developers should be aware of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: white;" id="p4">HTTP: The hypertext Transfer Protocol is used for web communications.</li>
        <li style="color: white;" id="p4">SSH: The secure Shell Protocol Allows remote command-line connection to servers. </li>
        <li style="color: white;" id="p4">FTP: The File Transfer Protocol is used for transferring files between computers.</li>
        <li style="color: white;" id="p4">POP/IMAP/SMTP: Email-related protocols for storing and transferring emails.</li>
        <li style="color: white;" id="p4">DNS:The Domain Name System Protocol used for resolving domain names to ip address.</li>
    </ul>
